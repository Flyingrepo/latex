\end[center]

News has become an important medium for everyone to stay aware and updated with the latest happenings in the world.

Fake news causes a lot of economic and social problems. It also gets difficult to trace back the source of fake news and hold someone accountable in order to curb it down.

Our project aims to create a platform that runs on a blockchain network. News based media will be shared across this network.

The platform will be highly intuitive and interactive for users to browse through different sections of news.
